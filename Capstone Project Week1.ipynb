    "# Problem\n",
    "In Singapore, public housing are named as the ubiquitious HDB flats. Due to the growing economy and land scarce nature of the island nature, property prices are on a general uptrend. Despite it being public housing, lease holders have the right to buy and sell their HDB flats allowing for a chance for profit.  \n",
    "Despite public data on transaction prices being available, it is still a challenge to determine the right price to sell at. This data science project aims to identify the factors that influence real estate prices and hopes to develop a predictive model considering those factors to provide future sellers with a data informed pricing guide to sell at.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem statement is: What is/are the key feature(s) that influences HDB transaction prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "The major benefit of this business problem and its solution to clients or stakeholders is improved decision making in evaluating the impact of different factors to the price of flat for buying/selling evaluation. \n"

    "Transaction prices are the end outcome of what we are trying to predict. \n",
