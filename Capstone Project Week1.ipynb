    "# Problem\n",
    "In Singapore, public housing are named as the ubiquitious HDB flats. Due to the growing economy and land scarce nature of the island nature, property prices are on a general uptrend. Despite it being public housing, lease holders have the right to buy and sell their HDB flats allowing for a chance for profit.  \n",
    "Despite public data on transaction prices being available, it is still a challenge to determine the right price to sell at. This data science project aims to identify the factors that influence real estate prices and hopes to develop a predictive model considering those factors to provide future sellers with a data informed pricing guide to sell at."

Its dataset includes Town, Flat type, Block, Street name, Storey range, Floor area sqm, Flat model, Lease commence date, Remaining lease. The 9 factors is presents a sufficiently wide range of factors for the purposes of the study.  \n",
    "Foursquare API data can be used to ascertain nearby amenities and provide a supporting view1. The focus of the study will be on a regression model and thus will not apply the clustering methodology used in the course. It is the author's intention to explore methods beyond what was taught in the course rather than replicating the course steps. \n",
